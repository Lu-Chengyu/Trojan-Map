# TrojanMap

## TrojanMap

This project focuses on using data structures in C++ and implementing various graph algorithms to build a map application.

<p align="center"><img src="img/TrojanMap.png" alt="Trojan" width="500" /></p>

- Please clone the repository, read through [README.md](README.md).
- Please make sure that your code can run `bazel run` and `bazel test`.

---

## The Data Structure

Each point on the map is represented by the class **Node** shown below and defined in [trojanmap.h](src/lib/trojanmap.h).

```cpp
class Node {
 public:
  Node(){};
  Node(const Node &n) {
    id = n.id;
    lat = n.lat;
    lon = n.lon;
    name = n.name;
    neighbors = n.neighbors;
    attributes = n.attributes;
  };
  std::string id;    // A unique id assign to each point
  double lat;        // Latitude
  double lon;        // Longitude
  std::string name;  // Name of the location. E.g. "Bank of America".
  std::vector<std::string>
      neighbors;  // List of the ids of all neighbor points.
  std::unordered_set<std::string>
      attributes;  // List of the attributes of the location.
};
```

---

## Prerequisites

### External Libraries Installation

For visualization, we use `OpenCV` library. You will use this library as a black box and don't need to worry about the graphic details. Use the following commands to install OpenCV and other libraries.

#### For Macos Users

Step 1. type the following three lines in your terminal
```shell
$ brew install cmake
$ brew install opencv
$ brew install ncurses
```

Step 2.

Check the installation paths of opencv and ncurses by

```shell
brew info opencv
```

and

```shell
brew info ncurses
```

respectively, and update their paths in the `WORKSPACE` file of your project root directory with the actual installation paths



#### For Ubuntu users
Step 1. 
```shell
$ cd **your project folder**
$ git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install cmake libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config
$ sudo apt install libcanberra-gtk-module libcanberra-gtk3-module
$ sudo apt install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
$ cp ubuntu/* ./
```

Step 2. Make sure you set the **path_to_install_folder** to be the absolute path to the **install** folder under opencv when running the following commands

```shell
$ cd opencv/
$ mkdir build install
$ cd build
$ cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=**path_to_install_folder** -D BUILD_LIST=core,highgui,imgcodecs,imgproc,videoio ..
$ make install
```

For example, if cloned this repo under `"/Users/ari/github/TrojanMap"`, you should type:

```shell
$ cd opencv/
$ mkdir build install
$ cd build
$ cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Users/ari/github/TrojanMap/opencv/install -D BUILD_LIST=core,highgui,imgcodecs,imgproc,videoio ..
$ make install
```

## Run the program

For MacOS users, run

```shell
$ bazel run src/main:main
```

For Ubuntu users, run
               
```shell
$ bazel run --cxxopt='-std=c++17' src/main:main
```

If everything is correct, a menu similar to this will show up.

```shell

## Test The Program

I created some tests to test the program, please run
```shell
$ bazel test tests:trojanmap_test
```

You can add your test in the [trojanmap_test_student.cc](tests/trojanmap_test_student.cc) and run

```shell
$ bazel test tests:trojanmap_test_student
```

## Item 1: Autocomplete The Location Name

```c++
std::vector<std::string> Autocomplete(std::string name);
```

I consider the names of nodes as the locations. Implemented a method to type the partial name of the location and return a list of possible locations with partial name as prefix. Treated uppercase and lower case as the same character. Returned an empty output if the input string is empty.

Example:

Input: "Chi" \
Output: ["Chick-fil-A", "Chipotle", "Chinese Street Food"]

Example:

```shell

## Item 2-1: Find the place's coordinates in the Map

```c++
std::pair<double, double> GetPosition(std::string name);
```

Given a location name, return the latitude and longitude. There are no duplicated location names. I marked the given locations on the map. If the location does not exist, return (-1, -1). The algorithm is case-sensitive.

Example:

Input: "Target" \
Output: (34.0257016, -118.2843512)

```shell
**************************************************************
* 2. Find the position

```

<p align="center"><img src="img/Target.png" alt="Target" width="500"/></p>

## Item 2-2: Check Edit Distance Between Two Location Names

```c++
int CalculateEditDistance(std::string name1, std::string name2);
```

When entering a location name that does not exist in the map, my program  determine whether the input can be replaced with a "similar name" or not. By "similar names" I mean the names that exist in the map with a *smallest distance* from the original input. 

The distance between two names A and B is the minimum number of operations required to convert A to B. There are 3 operations:
+ Insert a character
+ Delete a character
+ Replace a character

If the exact match is found, it will be shown on the map. Otherwise, the map will show the most similar name by using FindClosestName and print a warning. 

For example, if I type *Rolphs*, I would get a warning like "Did you mean *Ralphs* instead of *Rolphs*?". 

Write a dynamic programming solution to calculate edit distance. 

```c++
std::string FindClosestName(std::string name);
```

Example:

Input: "Rolphs", "Ralphs" \
Output: 1


In the user interface of my program, I show the names that have the minimum edit distance to the name that the user entered.

Example:

Input: "Rolphs"\
Output: "Ralphs"

```shell
**************************************************************
* 2. Find the location

Latitude: 34.0318 Longitude: -118.291
**************************************************************
Time taken by function: 2 ms
```

## Item 3: Get All Categories (Phase 2)

```c++
std::vector<std::string> GetAllCategories();
```

Some of the locations have category types (`attributes` field in `data.csv` file). 

In this section, my program prints all available categories among all existing categories in the map. There would be no duplicates in the output.

## Item 4: Get All Locations In A Category (Phase 2)

```c++
std::vector<std::string> GetAllLocationsFromCategory(std::string category);
```

In this section if the user entries a category, the program prints all locations that match that category. For example, if there is a category called "bank", my program wwould print all location ids that match the "bank" category. 

## Item 5: Get Locations Using A Regular Expression (Phase 2)

```c++
std::vector<std::string> GetLocationRegex(std::regex location);
```

In this section if the user enters a [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), they should see all location ids that match that regular expression.

My program would also verify if the input regular expression was correct. Return an empty vector if the regex is not valid or matches no items.


## Item 6: CalculateShortestPath between two places

```c++
std::vector<std::string> CalculateShortestPath_Dijkstra(std::string &location1_name,
                                               std::string &location2_name);
std::vector<std::string> CalculateShortestPath_Bellman_Ford(std::string &location1_name,
                                               std::string &location2_name);
```

Given 2 locations A and B, find the best route from A to B. The distance between 2 points is the euclidean distance using latitude and longitude. I use both Dijkstra algorithm and Bellman-Ford algorithm. Compare the time for the different methods. Show the routes on the map. If there is no path, return empty vector.

Example

## Item 7: Cycle Detection (Phase 2)

```c++
bool CycleDetection(std::vector<double> &square);
```

In this section, I use a square-shaped subgraph of the original graph by using four coordinates stored in ```std::vector<double> square```, which follows the order of left, right, upper, and lower bounds. 

Then determine if there is a cycle path in the that subgraph.
If it does, return true and report the path of the cycle on the map. Otherwise return false.

Example 1:
```shell
Input: square = {-118.299, -118.264, 34.032, 34.011}
Output: true
```
Here I use the whole original graph as my subgraph. 
<p align="center"><img src="img/cycle1.png" alt="TSP" width="500"/></p>

Example 2:
```shell
Input: square = {-118.290, -118.289, 34.030, 34.020}
Output: false
```
Here I use a square area inside USC campus as my subgraph

## Item 8: Topological Sort (Phase 2)

```c++
std::vector<std::string> DeliveringTrojan(std::vector<std::string> &location_names,
                                            std::vector<std::vector<std::string>> &dependencies);
```
In this section, I assume that I am using a UAV which means I can fly directly from 1 point to another point. Tommy Trojan got a part-time job from TrojanEats, for which he needs to pick up and deliver food from local restaurants to various location near the campus. Tommy needs to visit a few different location near the campus with certain order, since there are some constraints. For example, he must first get the food from the restaurant before arriving at the delivery point. 

The TrojanEats app will have some instructions about these constraints. So, Tommy asks it to help him figure out the feasible route!

Here Tommy will give the program a vector of location names that he needs to visit, and also some dependencies between those locations.


For example, 

```shell
Input: 
location_names = {"Ralphs", "Chick-fil-A", "KFC"}
dependencies = {{"Ralphs","KFC"}, {"Ralphs","Chick-fil-A"}, {"Chick-fil-A", "KFC"}}
```

Here, ```{"Ralphs","KFC"}``` means
that Tommy must go to `Ralphs` prior to `KFC`.

Output should be:
```shell
Output: Ralphs  -> Chick-fil-A -> KFC
```
Also, I provide ```PlotPointsOrder``` function that can visualize the results on the map. It will plot each location name and also some arrowed lines to demonstrate a feasible route.

If no feasible route exists, I simply return an empty vector.


Below is an example output of 3 nodes
```shell
*************************Results******************************
Topological Sorting Results:
Ralphs
Chick-fil-A
KFC
**************************************************************
Time taken by function: 2 ms
```
<p align="center"><img src="img/TopologicalSort.png" alt="TSP" width="500"/></p>

In the user interface, I read the locations and dependencies from `topologicalsort_dependencies.csv` and `topologicalsort_locations.csv` to modify the input there.


## Item 9: The Traveling Trojan Problem (AKA Traveling Salesman!) 

In this section, I assume that I am using a UAV which means I can fly directly from 1 point to another point. Given a vector of location ids, assume every location can reach all other locations in the vector (i.e. assume that the vector of location ids is a complete graph).
The program finds the shortest route that covers all the locations exactly once and goes back to the start point. 

The program would return the progress to get the shortest route which will then be converted to an animation.  

The program uses the following algorithms:

- Brute-force (i.e. generating all permutations, and returning the minimum)
```c++
std::pair<double, std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>> TravelingTrojan_Brute_force(
      std::vector<std::string> location_ids);
```
- Brute-force enhanced with early backtracking
```c++
std::pair<double, std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>> TravelingTrojan_Backtracking(
      std::vector<std::string> location_ids);
```
- [2-opt Heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-opt). Also see [this paper](http://cs.indstate.edu/~zeeshan/aman.pdf)
```c++
std::pair<double, std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>> TravelingTrojan_2opt(
      std::vector<std::string> location_ids);
```

The program would show the routes on the map. For each intermediate solution, create a new plot. 

```shell

## Item 10: Find Nearby

Given an attribute name `C`, a location name `L` and a number `r` and `k`, find at most `k` locations in attribute `C` on the map near `L`(do not include `L`) with the range of `r` and return a vector of string ids. 

The order of locations would be from nearest to farthest, and it would not include the current location. 

```c++
std::vector<std::string> TrojanMap::FindNearby(std::string attributesName, std::string name, double r, int k);
```

All attributes:
```
'artwork', 'attraction', 'bakery', 'bank', 'bar', 'beauty', 'beverages', 'bicycle', 'bicycle_rental', 'bus_station',

## Reporting Runtime:
For each menu item, my program show the time it took to finish each task.

## Extra things:
   1. Implementation of [3-opt](http://cs.indstate.edu/~zeeshan/aman.pdf).
   2. [Genetic algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/traveling-salesman-problem-using-genetic-algorithm/) implementation for Traveling Trojan
   3. Create dynamic and animated UI using [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses)
      - Uncomment #define NCURSES in main.cc and mapui.h
      - Create menu in DynamicPrintMenu().
      - Check https://github.com/ourarash/ncurses_bazel
      - Develope new UI.
      - Example
         <p align="center"><img src="img/ncurses example.gif" alt="example" width="500"/></p>
   4. Accurate measurement of the algorithm runtime using [Google Benchmark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VKR8u9odrA) while sweeping the input size and providing a diagram of how the runtime grows based on the input size.
